## Things You Should Be Able To Do

- List Files

## Listing Files

- To list use the command `ls`
- This will list all of the files and all of the folders in a given folder
- you can use `ls` with a foldername to list the things inside of that folder
- you can use `ls` with no arguments to list the things inside of the current folder

a folder and a directory are the same thing 

## Changing Directories

- we use the `cd` command
- `cd <foldername>` moves into the folder
- `cd` with no arguments move back to your home directory
- `cd ..` will move outside of a directory
- in general this `..` is a reference to the folder outside of the one you are in

## Creating Files

- `touch <filename>`
- `touch <filename1> <filename2>`

## Removing Files

- `rm <filename>`
- `rm <filename1> <filename2>`

## Creating Folders

- `mkdir <foldername>`

## Removing Folders

- `rm -rf <foldername>`
